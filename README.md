# SchoolBreaker - The Ultimate School Network and System Manipulation Tool

**Warning**: Use with caution. This is not for the faint-hearted. It is an advanced toolkit designed to bypass school network restrictions, elevate privileges, and manipulate system settings for complete control. This project will enable the user to:

- **Unlock WiFi Admin privileges** and hijack the school's network.
- **Bypass web filters** and access blocked websites (social media, streaming, etc.).
- **Unblock and run CMD with full admin privileges** even if blocked by the system.
- **Activate Stealth Mode** to hide traces of the tool on the machine.
- **Disable security monitoring services** to avoid detection.
- **Setup Proxy Tunnel** for anonymous internet access.
- **Crash the system** in case you need to disable the laptop or force shutdown it instantly.
